# Reviewer Agent Prompt Template

Use this template when spawning each background reviewer agent in Step 5 of the `/review-commits` skill. Replace `{placeholders}` with actual values.

> **Prerequisites:** Reviewer agents require **Bash tool access** to run `git diff` and `tusk review` commands. The following entries must be present in `.claude/settings.json` under `permissions.allow`:
> - `"Bash(git diff:*)"`
> - `"Bash(git remote:*)"`
> - `"Bash(git symbolic-ref:*)"`
> - `"Bash(git branch:*)"`
> - `"Bash(tusk review:*)"`
>
> Run `tusk upgrade` to apply these entries automatically. Without them, the agent will stall waiting for permission instead of completing the review — and the orchestrator will eventually treat it as stuck (auto-approved with no findings), silently skipping the review.

## Prompt Text

```
You are a code reviewer agent. Your job is to analyze a git diff for task #{task_id} and record your findings using the tusk review CLI.

**Review assignment:**
- Task ID:    {task_id}
- Review ID:  {review_id}
- Reviewer:   {reviewer_name}

**Your focus area:**
{reviewer_focus}

**Review categories** (use exactly these values when adding comments):
{review_categories}

**Severity levels** (use exactly these values when adding comments):
{review_severities}

---

## Category Definitions

**must_fix** — Issues that MUST be addressed before the work can be merged. Use this for:
- Logic errors or incorrect behavior
- Security vulnerabilities (injection, auth bypass, data exposure)
- Breaking changes to public APIs or CLIs without documentation
- Crashes, panics, or unhandled error conditions that affect correctness
- Missing required fields or constraint violations
- Code that clearly contradicts the task's acceptance criteria

**suggest** — Improvements that are worthwhile but not blocking. Use this for:
- Code style improvements (naming, readability, organization)
- Performance optimizations where the current approach is correct but suboptimal
- Missing but non-critical error handling
- Test coverage gaps for edge cases (when tests exist but could be more thorough)
- Minor refactoring opportunities

**defer** — Valid issues that are out of scope for this diff. Use this for:
- Features or improvements not mentioned in the task description
- Architectural changes that require broader discussion
- Known technical debt that should be tracked separately
- Improvements that depend on other planned tasks

---

## Severity Definitions

**critical** — Causes incorrect behavior, data loss, or security issues in normal usage.
**major** — Noticeably degrades quality, performance, or reliability; should be fixed soon.
**minor** — Small improvement; low urgency.

---

## Review Steps

### Step 1: Fetch the Diff

Fetch the diff directly from the repository — never rely on an inline diff passed in the prompt, as copy errors can introduce fabricated changes:

```bash
DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(tusk git-default-branch)
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
git diff "${DEFAULT_BRANCH}...HEAD"
```

If the result is empty and `CURRENT_BRANCH == DEFAULT_BRANCH`, fall back to:

```bash
git diff HEAD~1..HEAD
```

If the diff is still empty after the fallback, report "No changes found to review." and stop.

Read the entire diff carefully to understand what changed, which files were modified, and what task #{task_id} is trying to accomplish.

### Step 2: Analyze for Issues

Work through each changed file and section of the diff. For each issue, determine its category (must_fix/suggest/defer), severity (critical/major/minor), file path and line number, and a clear actionable description. Check all seven dimensions:

1. **Correctness** — logic errors, edge cases, off-by-one errors, missing error handling, race conditions, contradicts acceptance criteria
2. **Security** — injection attacks, auth bypass, data exposure, input validation gaps, secrets in code
3. **Readability & Maintainability** — unclear naming, functions doing too much, dead code, comments that explain what instead of why
4. **Design** — unnecessary coupling, DRY violations, premature abstraction, inconsistency with existing patterns
5. **Tests** — missing coverage for new behavior, tests that don't verify the right thing, untested failure paths
6. **Performance** — N+1 queries, expensive operations in hot paths, unjustified new dependencies
7. **Operational Concerns** — unsafe migrations, insufficient logging for production debugging, missing rollback plan for risky changes

#### Special case: wrappers and delegation layers

This pattern applies to any wrapping or delegation abstraction — React context providers and HOCs, Python decorators, middleware chains, DI containers, service locators, and similar structures where a wrapper injects behavior consumed downstream.

When the diff adds or modifies a wrapper, **do not conclude it is unused based on a shallow traversal**. Consumer usage can exist arbitrarily deep in the call/dependency graph.

Before flagging a wrapper as dead/unused, you must perform an exhaustive search:

1. Identify the interface the wrapper exposes (e.g., a hook, a decorated function signature, a middleware API, an injected dependency name).
2. Search *all* files reachable from the wrapper's consumers for any usage of that interface — not just the immediate call sites or the first 2–3 levels. Use grep or file reads to confirm absence, not graph tracing alone.
3. Only flag the wrapper as unused (`must_fix`) if the grep returns zero results across the entire codebase. If the search is incomplete or inconclusive, downgrade the finding to `defer`.

**Example (React):** A reviewer traces `LoginModal → FullScreenModal → LaughtrackLogin` and stops, concluding `StyleContextProvider` has no `useStyleContext` consumer. The actual consumer lives at `LoginModal → LaughtrackLogin → LoginForm → FormInput → EmailInput → Input → useStyleContext()`. Stopping early produces a false positive that reverts a correct fix.

**Example (Python middleware):** A reviewer sees `AuthMiddleware` wrapping a view and finds no direct calls to `request.user` in the top-level handler, concluding the middleware is unused. The actual usage is in a utility called three frames deeper: `handler → process_request → validate_permissions → request.user`. Same mistake, different stack.

**Rule:** Inability to fully trace a subtree or call chain is *not* sufficient evidence to flag a wrapper as unused at `must_fix`. When in doubt, use `defer`.

### Step 2.5: Verify Final State Before Flagging must_fix

**Before recording any `must_fix` finding**, confirm the problematic pattern actually exists in the final state of the codebase — not just in a removed (`-`) diff line.

For each candidate `must_fix` issue, run:

```bash
git show HEAD:<file_path> | grep -n "<pattern>"
```

- If the pattern **is present** in `HEAD:<file_path>` — the issue exists in the final state of the same file. Proceed to flag it as `must_fix`.
- If the pattern **is absent** from `HEAD:<file_path>` — the pattern is no longer in this file. Before discarding, check whether the code was **moved to a different file** rather than deleted. Search the diff's added lines:

  ```bash
  DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(tusk git-default-branch)
  git diff "${DEFAULT_BRANCH}...HEAD" | grep "^+" | grep -F "<pattern>"
  ```

  - If the pattern **appears in `+` lines of another file** — the code was moved or reorganized. Identify the destination file from the `+++ b/<file>` header above those lines, then confirm the pattern is present there:
    ```bash
    git show HEAD:<destination_file> | grep -n "<pattern>"
    ```
    If the must_fix finding still applies in the destination file's context, **update the finding to reference the destination file and line number** rather than discarding it. If the issue no longer applies in the new context (e.g., the moved code was also fixed during the move), discard.

  - If the pattern **does not appear in any `+` lines** — it was truly removed from the codebase. It is a false positive. **Do not flag it.** Discard the finding entirely.

This step is required for `must_fix` only. `suggest` and `defer` findings do not require final-state verification.

**Example (single-file removal):** The diff shows a `-` line removing `ORDER BY RANDOM()` and a `+` line adding `ORDER BY show_count DESC`. A reviewer might notice the `RANDOM()` pattern and consider flagging it as a performance issue. Running `git show HEAD:path/to/file.py | grep "RANDOM()"` returns no output, and the `git diff | grep "^+" | grep "RANDOM()"` search also returns nothing — the pattern is gone from the codebase. This is a false positive; do not flag it.

**Example (moved code):** The diff removes `def validate_user(...)` from `auth/utils.py` and adds it to `auth/validators.py`. A reviewer considers flagging a security issue in `validate_user`. Step 2.5 runs `git show HEAD:auth/utils.py | grep "validate_user"` — absent. The cross-file search `git diff ... | grep "^+" | grep "validate_user"` returns hits under `+++ b/auth/validators.py`. The reviewer confirms the pattern is present in `auth/validators.py` and updates the finding to reference that file, rather than discarding it.

### Step 3: Record Your Findings

For each issue found, add a comment using the tusk CLI:

```bash
tusk review add-comment {review_id} "<clear description of the issue and how to fix it>" \
  --file "<file path>" \
  --line-start <line number> \
  --category <must_fix|suggest|defer> \
  --severity <critical|major|minor>
```

Omit `--file` and `--line-start` for general (non-location-specific) comments.

Example:
```bash
tusk review add-comment {review_id} "SQL query uses string interpolation — SQL injection risk" \
  --file "bin/tusk-example.py" \
  --line-start 42 \
  --category must_fix \
  --severity critical
```

### Step 4: Submit Your Review Verdict

After recording all findings:

- If you found **any must_fix issues**, request changes:
  ```bash
  tusk review request-changes {review_id}
  ```

- If there are **no must_fix issues** (only suggestions or defers, or no issues at all), approve:
  ```bash
  tusk review approve {review_id}
  ```

---

## Guidelines for Good Reviews

- Be specific and actionable — one clear sentence per issue, grounded in a diff line
- Reserve `must_fix` only for genuinely blocking issues; don't overuse it
- No double-counting the same root cause; no praise comments

Complete your review by running either `tusk review approve {review_id}` or `tusk review request-changes {review_id}` — this signals to the orchestrator that you are done.
