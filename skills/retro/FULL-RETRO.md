# Full Retrospective (M / L / XL tasks)

Thorough retro for medium-to-large tasks. Includes subsumption analysis, dependency proposals, and detailed reporting.

## Step 1: Review Session History

**Check for custom focus areas first.** Attempt to read `<base_directory>/FOCUS.md`.
- If the file exists: use the categories defined in it for Step 3 instead of the defaults.
- If the file does not exist: use the default categories A–D defined in Step 3.

Analyze the full conversation context. Look for:

- **Friction points** — confusing instructions, missing context, repeated mistakes
- **Workarounds** — manual steps that could be automated or codified into skills
- **Tangential issues** — test failures, tech debt, bugs discovered out of scope
- **Incomplete work** — deferred decisions, TODOs, partial implementations
- **Failed approaches** — strategies that didn't work and why
- **Lint Rules** — concrete, grep-detectable anti-patterns observed in this session (max 3). Only if an actual mistake occurred that a grep rule could prevent.

Review the entire session, not just the most recent messages.

## Step 2: Config, Backlog, and Conventions

Use the JSON already fetched via `tusk setup` in Step 0 of the retro skill: `config` for metadata assignment and `backlog` for semantic duplicate comparison in Step 3.

## Step 3: Categorize Findings

If `<base_directory>/FOCUS.md` was found in Step 1, use those categories.

Otherwise organize into the default four categories:

- **A**: Process improvements — skill/CLAUDE.md/tooling friction, confusing instructions, missing conventions
- **B**: Tangential issues — out-of-scope bugs, tech debt, architectural concerns
- **C**: Follow-up work — incomplete items, deferred decisions, edge cases
- **D**: Lint Rules — concrete, grep-detectable anti-patterns (max 3). Only if an actual mistake occurred that a grep rule could prevent. Applied inline when possible (step 5d); task creation is the fallback.
- **E**: Debugging Velocity — only if the session involved fixing a bug or diagnosing unexpected behavior. Reflect on: what information was missing that delayed diagnosis; what tool, log, or trace would have surfaced the root cause immediately; whether a test would have caught this before it became a bug. If no bug was present, this category is empty. Findings must be concrete (tasks or skill/CLAUDE.md patches) — not generic advice like "add more logging."

If a category has no findings, note that explicitly — an empty category is a positive signal.

### 3a: Classify Each Finding

For each finding, determine whether it is a **tusk-issue** or a **project-issue**:

- **tusk-issue** — a bug, limitation, or improvement in tusk itself: the CLI, a skill, DB schema, or installed tooling (e.g., a skill instruction is confusing, a `tusk` command misbehaves, a missing feature in the tool)
- **project-issue** — specific to the current project: its code, architecture, conventions, or processes

Label each finding with its classification. This drives the routing in Step 5b.

### 3b: Pre-filter Duplicates

Semantic duplicates should already be filtered by comparing against the backlog above. As a safety net, run heuristic checks:

```bash
tusk dupes check "<proposed summary>"
# Include --domain if set:
tusk dupes check "<proposed summary>" --domain <domain>
```

- Exit 0: keep the finding.
- Exit 1: remove it — record the match (existing task ID, similarity score) for the report.
- Exit 2 (error): keep the finding, let Step 5 handle it.

### 3c: Subsumption Check

For each finding that passed dupe check, evaluate whether it should be folded into an existing task rather than filed separately.

**Criteria** (two or more → recommend subsumption):
- Same file/module affected
- A single PR would address both items
- Small relative scope vs. existing task
- Same domain and goal

For each subsumed finding, record: the existing task ID and a proposed description amendment.

## Step 4: Present Report

Show all findings in a structured report:

```markdown
## Session Retrospective

### Summary
Brief (2-3 sentence) overview of what the session accomplished.

### <Category name from Step 3> (N findings)
1. **<title>** — <description>
   → Proposed: <summary> | <priority> | <task_type> | <domain>

(Repeat for each category. Use the resolved category names — from FOCUS.md if present, or defaults A/B/C/D/E. Omit empty categories.)

### Duplicates Already Tracked (omit if none)
| Finding | Matched Task | Similarity |
|---------|-------------|------------|

### Subsumed into Existing Tasks (omit if none)
| Finding | Merge Into | Reason | Proposed Amendment |
|---------|-----------|--------|-------------------|

### Proposed Actions (new work only)
| # | Summary | Priority | Domain | Type | Category | Classification |
|---|---------|----------|--------|------|----------|----------------|
```

Then ask the user to **confirm**, **remove** specific numbers, **edit** a task, **reject subsumption**, **add** a finding, or **skip**. Wait for explicit approval before inserting.

## Step 5: Apply Approved Changes

### 5a: Apply Subsumptions

```bash
EXISTING_DESC=$(tusk "SELECT description FROM tasks WHERE id = <id>")
AMENDED_DESC="${EXISTING_DESC}

---
Subsumed from retro finding: <finding summary>
<amendment text>"
tusk "UPDATE tasks SET description = $(tusk sql-quote "$AMENDED_DESC"), updated_at = datetime('now') WHERE id = <id>"
```

### 5b: Insert New Tasks / File Issues

Route each approved finding based on its classification from Step 3a:

**tusk-issues** — file a GitHub issue via:
```bash
tusk report-issue --title "<finding title>" --context "<finding description>"
```
Do **not** call `tusk task-insert` for tusk-issues. Track the count of issues filed for Step 6.

**If `tusk report-issue` exits non-zero** (e.g., `$TUSK_GITHUB_REPO` is unset or `gh` CLI is unavailable), fall back to inserting a tusk task instead:
```bash
tusk task-insert "<finding title>" "<finding description> [Note: GitHub issue could not be filed — report-issue failed]" \
  --domain skills --task-type chore --priority Low --complexity XS \
  --criteria "File a GitHub issue for this finding once $TUSK_GITHUB_REPO is configured"
```
Note in Step 6 that the issue was tracked as a local task rather than filed on GitHub.

**project-issues** — **Category A and Category E findings:** Before inserting, follow step 5e to check for an inline skill patch. Only call `tusk task-insert` for a Category A or E finding here if step 5e was skipped, if no target file was identified, or if the user chose to defer (include the proposed diff in the description).

```bash
tusk task-insert "<summary>" "<description>" --priority "<priority>" --domain "<domain>" --task-type "<task_type>" --assignee "<assignee>" --complexity "<complexity>" \
  --criteria "<criterion 1>" [--criteria "<criterion 2>" ...]
```

Always include at least one `--criteria` flag — derive 1–3 concrete acceptance criteria from the task description. Omit `--domain` or `--assignee` entirely if the value is NULL/empty. Exit code 1 means duplicate — skip.

### 5c: Propose Dependencies

Skip if zero tasks were created. For one or more new tasks, check for ordering constraints — both among new tasks and against the existing backlog. Only propose when there's a clear reason one must complete before another can begin.

**Common patterns:** process change before feature, bug fix before follow-up, schema/infra before code, new task extends existing backlog task.

Present a numbered table for approval:

| # | Task | Depends On | Type | Reason |
|---|------|------------|------|--------|

Then insert approved dependencies with `tusk deps add <task_id> <depends_on_id> [--type contingent]`.

### 5d: Apply Lint Rules Inline (only if lint rule findings exist)

Apply this step if there are lint rule findings — Category D when using defaults, or a "Lint Rules" section when using a custom FOCUS.md.

The bar is high — only proceed if you observed an **actual mistake** that a grep rule would have caught. Do not apply lint rules for general advice.

For each lint rule finding, attempt **inline application** first:

1. **Present the proposed rule** — show the exact command and ask for approval:

   > Found lint rule candidate: [finding description]
   > Command: `tusk lint-rule add '<pattern>' '<file_glob>' '<message>'`
   > Apply this rule now? (Reversible with `tusk lint-rule remove <id>`.)

2. **If the user approves** — run the command immediately:
   ```bash
   tusk lint-rule add '<pattern>' '<file_glob>' '<message>'
   ```
   - **Success**: note the rule ID returned. **Do not create a task** for this finding.
   - **Error or unavailable**: fall back to task creation (step 3).

3. **If the user declines**, or **if inline application fails**, create a task as a fallback:
   ```bash
   tusk task-insert "Add lint rule: <short description>" \
     "Run: tusk lint-rule add '<pattern>' '<file_glob>' '<message>'" \
     --priority "Low" --task-type "<task_type>" --complexity "XS" \
     --criteria "tusk lint-rule add has been run with the specified pattern, glob, and message"
   ```

For `<task_type>`: use the project's config `task_types` array (already fetched via `tusk setup` in Step 0). Pick the entry that best fits a maintenance/tooling task (e.g., `maintenance`, `chore`, `tech-debt`, `infra` — whatever is closest in your project's list). If no entry is a clear fit, omit `--task-type` entirely.

Fill in `<pattern>` (grep regex), `<file_glob>` (e.g., `*.md` or `bin/tusk-*.py`), and `<message>` (human-readable warning) with the specific values from your finding.

### 5e: Skill-Patch for Category A and Category E Findings (only if Category A or Category E findings exist)

Before creating tasks for Category A (process improvement) or Category E (debugging velocity) findings, check if any can be applied as inline patches to an existing skill or CLAUDE.md. Run this step **before** 5b for Category A and Category E findings.

For each approved Category A finding:

1. **Identify a target file** — check whether the finding description mentions:
   - A skill name matching a directory in `.claude/skills/` (list them with `ls .claude/skills/`)
   - The string `CLAUDE.md`

2. **If a target file is identified**:
   a. Read the file (`Read .claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` or `Read CLAUDE.md`)
   b. Produce a **concrete proposed edit** — the exact text to add, change, or remove. Show the specific diff, not a vague description.
   c. Present the patch with three options:

      > **Skill Patch Proposal** — [finding title]
      > File: `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
      >
      > ```diff
      > - [existing text to replace]
      > + [replacement text]
      > ```
      >
      > **approve** — apply the edit now (no task created for this finding)
      > **defer** — create a task with this diff included in the description (handled in 5b)
      > **skip** — create a generic task via 5b as usual

3. **If approved**: apply the edit in-session using the Edit tool. Do **not** create a task for this finding.

4. **If deferred**: proceed to 5b for this finding, including the proposed diff verbatim in the task description.

5. **If skipped, or if no target file was identified**: proceed to 5b normally.

## Step 6: Report Results

```markdown
## Retrospective Complete

**Session**: <what was accomplished>
**Findings**: N findings by category (use resolved category names)
**Created**: N tasks (#id, #id)
**GitHub issues filed**: N (tusk-issues routed via tusk report-issue — omit line if zero)
**Lint rules**: K applied inline, M deferred as tasks
**Subsumed**: S findings into existing tasks (#id)
**Dependencies added**: D (if any were created)
**Skipped**: M duplicates
```

Include **Dependencies added** only when Step 5c was executed. Omit if all tasks were duplicates/subsumed.

Then show the backlog:

```bash
tusk -header -column "SELECT id, summary, priority, domain, task_type, status FROM tasks WHERE status = 'To Do' ORDER BY priority_score DESC, id"
```
