# Retrospective Skill

Reviews the current conversation history to capture process learnings, instruction improvements, and tangential issues. Creates structured follow-up tasks so nothing falls through the cracks.

> Use `/create-task` for task creation — handles decomposition, deduplication, criteria, and deps. Use `tusk task-insert` only for bulk/automated inserts.

## Step 0: Setup

Fetch config, backlog, then determine retro mode:

```bash
tusk "SELECT complexity FROM tasks WHERE status = 'Done' ORDER BY updated_at DESC LIMIT 1"
tusk setup
```

Parse the JSON from `tusk setup`: use `config` for metadata assignment and `backlog` for duplicate comparison.

- **XS or S** → follow the **Lightweight Retro** path below
- **M, L, XL, or NULL** → read the full retro guide:
  ```
  Read file: <base_directory>/FULL-RETRO.md
  ```
  Then follow Steps 1–6 from that file. Do not continue below.

## Lightweight Retro (XS/S tasks)

Streamlined retro for small tasks. Skips subsumption analysis and dependency proposals.

### LR-1: Review & Categorize

**Check for custom focus areas first.** Attempt to read `<base_directory>/FOCUS.md`.
- If the file exists: use the categories defined in it for the analysis below.
- If the file does not exist: use the default categories:
  - **Category A**: Process improvements — friction in skills, CLAUDE.md, tooling
  - **Category B**: Tangential issues — bugs, tech debt, architectural concerns discovered out of scope
  - **Category C**: Follow-up work — incomplete items, deferred decisions, edge cases
  - **Category D**: Lint Rules — concrete, grep-detectable anti-patterns observed in this session (max 3). Only include if an actual mistake occurred that a grep rule could prevent — e.g., calling a deprecated command, using a wrong pattern in a specific file type. Do NOT include general advice or style preferences.
  - **Category E**: Debugging Velocity — only if the session involved fixing a bug or diagnosing unexpected behavior. Reflect on: what information was missing that delayed diagnosis; what tool, log, or trace would have surfaced the root cause immediately; whether a test would have caught this before it became a bug. If no bug was present, this category is empty. Findings must be concrete (tasks or skill/CLAUDE.md patches) — not generic advice like "add more logging."

Analyze the full conversation context using the resolved categories.

If **all categories are empty**, report "Clean session — no findings" and stop. (Config and backlog were already fetched in Step 0 — no additional work needed.)

### LR-1b: Classify Each Finding

For each finding, determine whether it is a **tusk-issue** or a **project-issue**:

- **tusk-issue** — a bug, limitation, or improvement in tusk itself: the CLI, a skill, DB schema, or installed tooling (e.g., a skill instruction is confusing, a `tusk` command misbehaves, a missing feature in the tool)
- **project-issue** — specific to the current project: its code, architecture, conventions, or processes

Label each finding with its classification. This drives the routing in LR-2.

### LR-2: Create Tasks / File Issues (only if findings exist)

1. Compare each finding against the backlog for semantic overlap (use `backlog` from Step 0). Drop any already covered.

2. Run heuristic dupe check on surviving findings:
   ```bash
   tusk dupes check "<proposed summary>"
   ```

3. Present findings and proposed actions in a table (include the classification from LR-1b). Wait for explicit user approval before acting.

4. For each approved finding, route based on its LR-1b classification:

   **tusk-issues** — file a GitHub issue via:
   ```bash
   tusk report-issue --title "<finding title>" --context "<finding description>"
   ```
   Do **not** call `tusk task-insert` for tusk-issues. Track the count of issues filed for LR-3.

   **Include a `## Failing Test` section** in `--context` whenever a concrete test can be derived from the finding. This matters because `/address-issue` Factor 0 treats a missing failing test as the highest-priority signal to Defer — issues filed without one will be deprioritized automatically. Format:

   ```
   <finding description>

   ## Failing Test

   <shell command that currently fails or demonstrates the bug>
   ```

   If no concrete test exists (e.g. a pure UX or documentation finding), omit the section rather than fabricating one.

   **If `tusk report-issue` exits non-zero** (e.g., `$TUSK_GITHUB_REPO` is unset or `gh` CLI is unavailable), fall back to inserting a tusk task instead:
   ```bash
   tusk task-insert "<finding title>" "<finding description> [Note: GitHub issue could not be filed — report-issue failed]" \
     --domain skills --task-type chore --priority Low --complexity XS \
     --criteria "File a GitHub issue for this finding once $TUSK_GITHUB_REPO is configured"
   ```
   Note in LR-3 that the issue was tracked as a local task rather than filed on GitHub.

   **project-issues** — For **Category A and Category E** approved findings, follow **LR-2a** below before inserting tasks. For all other project-issue findings, insert tasks now:
   ```bash
   tusk task-insert "<summary>" "<description>" --priority "<priority>" --domain "<domain>" --task-type "<task_type>" --assignee "<assignee>" --complexity "<complexity>" \
     --criteria "<criterion 1>" [--criteria "<criterion 2>" ...]
   ```
   Always include at least one `--criteria` flag — derive 1–3 concrete acceptance criteria from the task description. Omit `--domain` or `--assignee` entirely if the value is NULL/empty. Exit code 1 means duplicate — skip. Skip subsumption and dependency proposals.

### LR-2a: Skill-Patch for Category A and Category E Findings (only if Category A or Category E findings exist)

Before creating tasks for Category A (process improvement) or Category E (debugging velocity) findings, check if any can be applied as inline patches to an existing skill or CLAUDE.md.

For each approved Category A finding:

1. **Classify the finding as rule-like or narrative:**
   - **Rule-like**: a single heuristic, invariant, or convention about how code or processes should work — e.g., "always quote file paths in zsh", "always pass `encoding='utf-8'` to `subprocess.run(text=True)`". These belong in the conventions DB via `tusk conventions add`.
   - **Narrative/reference**: multi-step procedures, workflow descriptions, explanatory context, or anything that requires more than one sentence to express correctly. These belong as a patch to a skill file or as a prose addition to CLAUDE.md.

2. **If the finding is rule-like** — propose adding a convention via `tusk conventions add`:
   a. Draft the exact convention text (one concise sentence) and a comma-separated list of relevant topic tags.
   b. Present the proposal with three options:

      > **Convention Proposal** — [finding title]
      >
      > ```
      > tusk conventions add "[concise rule text]" --topics "[tag1,tag2]"
      > ```
      >
      > **approve** — run the command now (no task created for this finding)
      > **defer** — create a task with this command included in the description
      > **skip** — create a generic task as usual

   c. **If approved**: run the command now using Bash. Do **not** create a task for this finding.
   d. **If deferred**: include the proposed command verbatim in the task description when calling `tusk task-insert`.
   e. **If skipped**: proceed to normal task creation (step 4 in LR-2).

3. **If the finding is narrative/reference** — identify a target file:
   - A skill name matching a directory in `.claude/skills/` (list them with `ls .claude/skills/`)
   - The string `CLAUDE.md`

   **If a target file is identified**:
   a. Read the file (`Read .claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` or `Read CLAUDE.md`)
   b. Produce a **concrete proposed edit** — the exact text to add, change, or remove. Show the specific diff, not a vague description.
   c. Present the patch with three options:

      > **Skill Patch Proposal** — [finding title]
      > File: `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
      >
      > ```diff
      > - [existing text to replace]
      > + [replacement text]
      > ```
      >
      > **approve** — apply the edit now (no task created for this finding)
      > **defer** — create a task with this diff included in the description
      > **skip** — create a generic task as usual

   d. **If approved**: apply the edit in-session using the Edit tool. Do **not** create a task for this finding.
   e. **If deferred**: include the proposed diff verbatim in the task description when calling `tusk task-insert`.
   f. **If skipped, or if no target file was identified**: proceed to normal task creation (step 4 in LR-2).

### LR-2b: Apply Lint Rules Inline (only if lint rule findings exist)

Apply this step if there are lint rule findings — Category D when using defaults, or a "Lint Rules" section when using a custom FOCUS.md.

The bar is high — only proceed if you observed an **actual mistake** that a grep rule would have caught. Do not apply lint rules for general advice.

For each lint rule finding, attempt **inline application** first:

1. **Present the proposed rule** — show the exact command and ask for approval:

   > Found lint rule candidate: [finding description]
   > Command: `tusk lint-rule add '<pattern>' '<file_glob>' '<message>'`
   > Apply this rule now? (Reversible with `tusk lint-rule remove <id>`.)

2. **If the user approves** — run the command immediately:
   ```bash
   tusk lint-rule add '<pattern>' '<file_glob>' '<message>'
   ```
   - **Success**: note the rule ID returned. **Do not create a task** for this finding.
   - **Error or unavailable**: fall back to task creation (step 3).

3. **If the user declines**, or **if inline application fails**, create a task as a fallback:
   ```bash
   tusk task-insert "Add lint rule: <short description>" \
     "Run: tusk lint-rule add '<pattern>' '<file_glob>' '<message>'" \
     --priority "Low" --task-type "<task_type>" --complexity "XS" \
     --criteria "tusk lint-rule add has been run with the specified pattern, glob, and message"
   ```

For `<task_type>`: use the project's config `task_types` array (already fetched via `tusk setup` in Step 0). Pick the entry that best fits a maintenance/tooling task (e.g., `maintenance`, `chore`, `tech-debt`, `infra` — whatever is closest in your project's list). If no entry is a clear fit, omit `--task-type` entirely.

Fill in `<pattern>` (grep regex), `<file_glob>` (e.g., `*.md` or `bin/tusk-*.py`), and `<message>` (human-readable warning) with the specific values from your finding.

### LR-3: Report

```markdown
## Retrospective Complete (Lightweight)

**Session**: <what was accomplished>
**Findings**: X total (by category — use resolved category names)
**Created**: N tasks (#id, #id)
**GitHub issues filed**: N (tusk-issues routed via tusk report-issue — omit line if zero)
**Lint rules**: K applied inline, M deferred as tasks
**Skipped**: M duplicates
```

Then show the current backlog:

```bash
tusk -header -column "SELECT id, summary, priority, domain, task_type, status FROM tasks WHERE status = 'To Do' ORDER BY priority_score DESC, id"
```

**End of lightweight retro.** Do not continue to FULL-RETRO.md.

---

## Customization

To override the default analysis categories, create a `FOCUS.md` file in the skill directory (replace `<base_directory>` with the actual path shown at the top of the loaded skill — typically `.claude/skills/retro`):

```
cp .claude/skills/retro/FOCUS.md.example .claude/skills/retro/FOCUS.md
# Edit FOCUS.md to define your custom categories
```

A template is available at `<base_directory>/FOCUS.md.example` showing the default category format. Custom categories replace A–D. Include a **"Lint Rules"** section to retain lint-rule handling.

`FOCUS.md` is not part of the distributed skill and will not be overwritten by `tusk upgrade`.
