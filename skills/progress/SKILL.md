# Progress Skill

Logs a progress checkpoint for a task by capturing the latest git commit (hash, message, changed files) into the `task_progress` table. This enables context recovery when resuming a task in a new session.

## Usage

```bash
tusk progress <task_id> [--next-steps "what remains to be done"]
```

The `--next-steps` flag is optional but strongly encouraged -- it records what still needs to happen, making it much easier for a future session to pick up where you left off.

Example:
```bash
tusk progress 42 --next-steps "Wire up the DELETE endpoint and add tests"
```

## Arguments

Parse the user's request to determine:
1. The task ID
2. Any next-steps context the user wants to record

Then run the command. Remind the user to provide `--next-steps` if they omitted it, as it significantly helps context recovery.
