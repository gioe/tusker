# Tusk Insights — Interactive Q&A

Companion file for `/tusk-insights` Phase 2. Contains query templates and analysis prompts for 5 discussion topics.

---

## Topic 1: Domain Alignment

**Purpose:** Assess whether task domains reflect actual project structure and workload distribution.

### Queries

**Task distribution by domain:**

```sql
SELECT domain, status, COUNT(*) as count
FROM tasks
WHERE domain IS NOT NULL AND domain <> ''
GROUP BY domain, status
ORDER BY domain, status;
```

**Domains with no open tasks:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT domain FROM tasks
WHERE domain IS NOT NULL AND domain <> ''
EXCEPT
SELECT DISTINCT domain FROM tasks
WHERE domain IS NOT NULL AND domain <> '' AND status <> 'Done';
```

**Tasks without a domain:**

```sql
SELECT id, summary, status
FROM tasks
WHERE (domain IS NULL OR domain = '')
  AND status <> 'Done'
ORDER BY id;
```

### Analysis Prompts

- Are any domains overloaded (many open tasks) while others are idle?
- Do the configured domains still match the project's current areas of work?
- Are there tasks that seem miscategorized based on their summary/description?

## Topic 2: Agent Effectiveness

**Purpose:** Evaluate agent workload and throughput using session metrics.

### Queries

**Tasks per agent:**

```sql
SELECT assignee, status, COUNT(*) as count
FROM tasks
WHERE assignee IS NOT NULL AND assignee <> ''
GROUP BY assignee, status
ORDER BY assignee, status;
```

**Agent cost and throughput:**

```sql
SELECT t.assignee,
       COUNT(DISTINCT t.id) as tasks_done,
       ROUND(SUM(s.cost_dollars), 2) as total_cost,
       SUM(s.tokens_in + s.tokens_out) as total_tokens,
       ROUND(AVG(s.duration_seconds / 60.0), 1) as avg_session_minutes
FROM tasks t
JOIN task_sessions s ON t.id = s.task_id
WHERE t.assignee IS NOT NULL AND t.assignee <> ''
  AND t.status = 'Done'
GROUP BY t.assignee
ORDER BY tasks_done DESC;
```

**Unassigned open tasks:**

```sql
SELECT id, summary, priority, status
FROM tasks
WHERE (assignee IS NULL OR assignee = '')
  AND status <> 'Done'
ORDER BY priority_score DESC, id;
```

### Analysis Prompts

- Which agents are most/least productive in terms of tasks completed?
- Is cost per task reasonable across agents?
- Are there unassigned tasks that should be routed to a specific agent?

---

## Topic 3: Workflow Patterns

**Purpose:** Analyze task lifecycle — how tasks flow from creation to completion.

### Queries

**Average time to completion by complexity:**

```sql
SELECT complexity,
       COUNT(*) as completed,
       ROUND(AVG(julianday(updated_at) - julianday(created_at)), 1) as avg_days
FROM tasks
WHERE status = 'Done' AND closed_reason = 'completed'
  AND complexity IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY complexity
ORDER BY
  CASE complexity
    WHEN 'XS' THEN 1 WHEN 'S' THEN 2 WHEN 'M' THEN 3
    WHEN 'L' THEN 4 WHEN 'XL' THEN 5
  END;
```

**Tasks stuck In Progress (> 3 days since last update):**

```sql
SELECT id, summary, complexity, updated_at,
       ROUND(julianday('now') - julianday(updated_at), 1) as days_stale
FROM tasks
WHERE status = 'In Progress'
  AND julianday('now') - julianday(updated_at) > 3
ORDER BY days_stale DESC;
```

**Closed reason breakdown:**

```sql
SELECT closed_reason, COUNT(*) as count,
       ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 1) as pct
FROM tasks
WHERE status = 'Done'
GROUP BY closed_reason
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

**Task creation rate (last 30 days):**

```sql
SELECT date(created_at) as day, COUNT(*) as created
FROM tasks
WHERE created_at >= datetime('now', '-30 days')
GROUP BY day
ORDER BY day;
```

### Analysis Prompts

- Are tasks being completed at a sustainable rate?
- Is complexity estimation accurate (do L/XL tasks actually take longer)?
- What percentage of tasks are closed as wont_do or duplicate (waste indicator)?
- Are there tasks stuck In Progress that need attention?

## Topic 4: Backlog Strategy

**Purpose:** Evaluate backlog health — size, age, prioritization quality.

### Queries

**Backlog size by priority:**

```sql
SELECT priority, COUNT(*) as count
FROM tasks
WHERE status = 'To Do'
GROUP BY priority
ORDER BY
  CASE priority
    WHEN 'Highest' THEN 1 WHEN 'High' THEN 2 WHEN 'Medium' THEN 3
    WHEN 'Low' THEN 4 WHEN 'Lowest' THEN 5
  END;
```

**Oldest open tasks:**

```sql
SELECT id, summary, priority, created_at,
       ROUND(julianday('now') - julianday(created_at), 0) as age_days
FROM tasks
WHERE status = 'To Do'
ORDER BY created_at
LIMIT 10;
```

**Blocked vs ready:**

```sql
-- blocked + ready = total To Do (mutually exclusive: blocked means dep-blocked or ext-blocked;
-- ready means neither; relationship_type = 'blocks' excludes contingent deps from both counts)
SELECT
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tasks t
    WHERE t.status = 'To Do'
    AND (
      EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM task_dependencies d
        JOIN tasks blocker ON d.depends_on_id = blocker.id
        WHERE d.task_id = t.id AND blocker.status <> 'Done'
          AND d.relationship_type = 'blocks'
      )
      OR EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM external_blockers eb
        WHERE eb.task_id = t.id AND eb.is_resolved = 0
      )
    )
  ) as blocked,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tasks t
    WHERE t.status = 'To Do'
    AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM task_dependencies d
      JOIN tasks blocker ON d.depends_on_id = blocker.id
      WHERE d.task_id = t.id AND blocker.status <> 'Done'
        AND d.relationship_type = 'blocks'
    )
    AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM external_blockers eb
      WHERE eb.task_id = t.id AND eb.is_resolved = 0
    )
  ) as ready;
```

**Complexity distribution (open tasks):**

```sql
SELECT complexity, COUNT(*) as count
FROM tasks
WHERE status <> 'Done'
GROUP BY complexity
ORDER BY
  CASE complexity
    WHEN 'XS' THEN 1 WHEN 'S' THEN 2 WHEN 'M' THEN 3
    WHEN 'L' THEN 4 WHEN 'XL' THEN 5
  END;
```

### Analysis Prompts

- Is the backlog growing faster than tasks are being completed?
- Are there very old tasks that should be closed or re-prioritized?
- Is the ratio of blocked to ready tasks healthy?
- Does the complexity mix suggest the backlog will take a long time to clear?

## Topic 5: Free-Form Exploration

**Purpose:** Let the user ask any question about their task data.

### Instructions

Ask the user what they'd like to explore. Common requests:

- "Show me all tasks related to X"
- "What's the most expensive task?"
- "How much have I spent total?"
- "Which tasks have the most dependencies?"

Build and run the appropriate read-only SQL query using `tusk`. Remember:

- **Read-only only** — SELECT statements only, never INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
- Use `tusk -header -column "..."` for formatted output
- Use `<>` instead of `!=` in SQL (shell history expansion conflict)
- Use `$(tusk sql-quote "...")` for any user-provided text in WHERE clauses
