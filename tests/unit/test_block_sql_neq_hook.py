"""Unit tests for the block-sql-neq.sh PreToolUse hook.

Verifies that the hook correctly distinguishes != inside a quoted string argument
(safe, should allow) from != in an unquoted context (should block).

Covers false-positive scenarios from GitHub Issues #411 (single-quoted args)
and #415 (double-quoted args, e.g. commit messages and task summaries).

Known tradeoff: stripping both quote types means != inside a double-quoted SQL
argument (e.g. tusk shell "...!= ...") is a false negative. This is acceptable
because SQL should use <> instead of != regardless.
