"""Consolidate groom-backlog auto-close pre-checks into a single CLI command.

Called by the tusk wrapper:
    tusk autoclose

Arguments received from tusk:
    sys.argv[1] — DB path
    sys.argv[2] — config path
    sys.argv[3:] — (unused, reserved for future flags)

Runs two pre-checks in one call:
  1. Expired deferred tasks → closed_reason = 'expired'
  2. Moot contingent tasks → closed_reason = 'wont_do'

For each closure, appends an annotation to the description and closes open sessions.
Prints a JSON summary with counts per category and closed task IDs.
