# Address Issue Skill

Fetches a GitHub issue, converts it into a tusk task, and immediately begins working on it using the full `/tusk` workflow.

## Step 1: Parse the Issue Reference

The user invokes this skill with an optional issue number or full URL. Examples:
- `/address-issue 314`
- `/address-issue https://github.com/gioe/tusk/issues/314`
- `/address-issue` *(no argument — defaults to newest open issue)*

Extract the issue number:
- If a full URL is given, parse the number from the path.
- If only a number is given, use it directly.
- If **no argument was provided**, fetch the newest open issue automatically:
  ```bash
  gh issue list --repo gioe/tusk --state open --limit 1 --json number,title
  ```
  If this returns an empty list, report:
  > No open issues found in gioe/tusk.

  Then stop. Otherwise, use the returned `number` and display:
  > No issue specified — defaulting to newest open issue: #<number> "<title>"

## Step 2: Fetch the Issue

Use `gh` to fetch the issue. Detect the repo from the argument:
- If a full URL was given, extract `owner/repo` from it.
- If only a number was given, default to `gioe/tusk`.

```bash
gh issue view <number> --repo <owner/repo> --json number,title,body,labels,comments,state
```

If the issue is already closed (`state: "CLOSED"`), warn the user:

> Issue #<N> is already closed. Do you still want to create a task for it?

Wait for confirmation before proceeding.

## Step 3: Fetch Config and Backlog

```bash
tusk setup
```

Store the `config` (domains, task_types, agents, priorities, complexity) and `backlog` (for duplicate detection).

## Step 4: Analyze the Issue and Determine Task Fields

Using the issue `title`, `body`, and `labels`, determine:

| Field | How to Determine |
|-------|-----------------|
| **summary** | Derive from the issue title — keep it imperative and under ~100 chars. Prefix with "Fix:" for bugs, otherwise use the title as-is or rephrase as an action. |
| **description** | Include the full issue body as context, plus the issue URL as a reference link. Format: `GitHub Issue #<N>: <url>\n\n<body>` |
| **priority** | Infer from labels: `priority: high` / `critical` / `urgent` → `High`/`Highest`; `priority: low` → `Low`; labels like `bug` or `regression` → lean `High`; default `Medium`. |
| **domain** | Match the issue's subject area to a configured domain. Leave NULL if no match. |
| **task_type** | `bug` for issues labeled `bug` or `defect`; `feature` for `enhancement`/`feature request`; `docs` for `documentation`; otherwise `feature`. |
| **assignee** | Match to a configured agent if the domain/labels clearly indicate one. Leave NULL if unsure. |
| **complexity** | Estimate from the issue body length and scope. Short reproduction steps with a clear fix → `S`; broad feature request → `M`; major architectural change → `L`. |

Generate **3–7 acceptance criteria** from the issue body — concrete, testable conditions. For bug issues, always include a criterion that the failure case is resolved and a regression test criterion.

## Step 4.5: Optional Codebase Investigation

**Skip this step entirely if complexity is XS or S.** Only run for M, L, or XL complexity issues.

After completing Step 4, offer the user a chance to investigate the codebase before presenting the task proposal:

> Before presenting the proposal, should I investigate the codebase for context? This helps surface relevant files, existing patterns, and edge cases that could sharpen the acceptance criteria. (**yes** / **no**, default: no)

Wait for the user's response. Treat any response other than an explicit **yes** as **no** — skip directly to Step 5 with no changes.

If the user says **yes**:

1. **Run a read-only investigation.** Use only these tools: `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, and `Bash` (restricted to read-only operations: `tusk` CLI queries, `ls`, directory inspection — no write commands, no `git commit`, no file edits). Limit the investigation to ~10 tool calls; stop and summarize what you found even if the picture is incomplete. Explore:
   - Files and functions directly related to the issue's subject area (search by keyword, class name, or config key mentioned in the issue body)
   - Existing tests for the affected code paths
   - Any conventions or patterns already established for similar features
   - Whether a partial implementation already exists

   Example queries:
   - Use the `Grep` tool to find files mentioning a keyword from the issue
   - Use the `Glob` tool to locate relevant test files
   - Query the tusk backlog for related tasks:
     ```bash
     tusk task-list --format json | python3 -c "import sys,json; tasks=json.load(sys.stdin); [print(t['id'], t['summary']) for t in tasks if '<keyword>' in t['summary'].lower()]"
     ```

2. **Summarize the findings** in a short block before proceeding:

   > **Codebase Investigation Findings:**
   > - <finding 1>
   > - <finding 2>
   > ...

3. **Refine the task fields** from Step 4 based on what you found:
   - Adjust `description` to reference specific files or functions that will need to change.
   - Add, remove, or sharpen acceptance criteria to reflect actual code structure (e.g., replace a vague criterion with one that names the specific function or test file).
   - Adjust `complexity` up or down if the codebase evidence warrants it.
   - Do **not** change the `summary`, `priority`, or `domain` unless the investigation reveals a fundamental misclassification.

Proceed to Step 5 with the updated task fields.

## Step 4.6: Reproducibility Check (bug-type only)

**Run this step only when `task_type = bug`.** Skip for all other task types.

Before presenting the proposal, quickly scan the codebase to confirm the bug is still present. Use at most 3 tool calls (Grep, Read, or Bash read-only). If you find clear evidence the bug is already fixed (e.g., the code path described in the issue no longer exists or has been corrected), surface this before proceeding:

> **Reproducibility note:** The issue may already be fixed — [brief explanation]. Do you still want to create a task?

Wait for user confirmation before proceeding to Step 5. If the bug is confirmed still present, or if you cannot determine either way within 3 calls, proceed without comment.

## Step 4.7: Model Recommendation

Evaluate the issue against the following five factors, **in priority order**, to produce an **Address / Defer / Decline** verdict with a 1–2 sentence rationale.

| # | Factor | How to Evaluate |
|---|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Pillar alignment** | Does the issue align with the project's design values in `PILLARS.md`? If `PILLARS.md` does not exist, skip this factor. Strong misalignment → bias toward Decline. |
| 2 | **Backlog coverage** | Is an open task already covering this issue (from the backlog fetched in Step 3)? If yes → **Decline** (duplicate). |
| 3 | **Scope relevance** | Does the issue fit the project's stated purpose? Out-of-scope requests → bias toward Decline. |
| 4 | **Severity / cost of inaction** | Does inaction risk data loss, user-facing breakage, or a security vulnerability? If yes → bias strongly toward **Address**. |
| 5 | **Issue quality** | Is the report clear, reproducible, and actionable? Vague, unverifiable, or too abstract → bias toward Decline. |

Assign one verdict:
- **Address** — valid, in-scope, aligns with pillars, adds clear value
- **Defer** — valid but low priority, nice-to-have, or blocked by higher-priority work
- **Decline** — out of scope, won't fix, already handled, duplicate, or too low-impact

Record the verdict and 1–2 sentence rationale for display in Step 5.

## Step 5: Present Proposed Task for Review

Open with a **Model Recommendation** block, then show the proposed task:

```markdown
### Model Recommendation

> **Recommendation: <Address / Defer / Decline>** — <1–2 sentence rationale from Step 4.7>

## Proposed Task from Issue #<N>

**<summary>** (<priority> · <domain> · <task_type> · <complexity>)
> <description preview — first 2 sentences>

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. <criterion 1>
2. <criterion 2>
...
```

Then ask, **bolding the option that matches the recommendation**:

- If recommendation is **Address**:
  > Create this task? You can **confirm** (implement now), defer (add to backlog, no immediate work), edit (e.g., "change priority to High"), decline (close the issue without creating a task), or cancel.

- If recommendation is **Defer**:
  > Create this task? You can confirm (implement now), **defer** (add to backlog, no immediate work), edit (e.g., "change priority to High"), decline (close the issue without creating a task), or cancel.

- If recommendation is **Decline**:
  > Create this task? You can confirm (implement now), defer (add to backlog, no immediate work), edit (e.g., "change priority to High"), **decline** (close the issue without creating a task), or cancel.

The user retains full veto power — any option may be chosen regardless of the recommendation.

Wait for explicit user approval before inserting.

### Decline Path

If the user types **decline** (optionally followed by a rationale, e.g., `decline out of scope`):

1. If no rationale was given inline, prompt:
   > Why are you declining this issue? Choose one or describe:
   > - `out of scope`
   > - `won't fix`
   > - `already handled by TASK-<id>`
   > - `duplicate of #<issue>`
   > - `other: <free text>`

   Wait for the user's response.

2. Close the GitHub issue with the rationale as a comment:
   ```bash
   gh issue close <number> --repo <owner/repo> --comment "Declined: <rationale>"
   ```

3. If `gh` succeeds, end with a decision summary:
   > **Declined** — Issue #<N> closed. Reason: <rationale>. No task created.

4. If `gh` fails, inspect the error output:
   - If the output contains the phrase `already in a 'closed'` (e.g. `already in a 'closed' state`), post the rationale as a standalone comment:
     ```bash
     gh issue comment <number> --repo <owner/repo> --body "Declined: <rationale>"
     ```
     - If the comment succeeds, end with:
       > Issue #<N> is already closed. Reason recorded: <rationale>. No task created.
     - If the comment also fails (e.g. issue is locked), fall through to the manual close URL below, adding a note that the issue is already closed.
   - Otherwise, report the error and show the manual close URL:
     > Could not close issue #<N> automatically. Please close it at: https://github.com/<owner/repo>/issues/<N>
     > Reason to use as a comment: "Declined: <rationale>"

5. **Do NOT insert a task.** Stop — do not proceed to Step 6.

### Defer Path

If the user types **defer**:

1. Proceed to Step 6 to deduplicate and insert the task (same insert flow as the implement-now path). Do NOT call `tusk task-start` or create a branch after insertion.

2. After the task is inserted, attempt to apply the `accepted` label to the GitHub issue so the decision is visible in the issue list without opening tusk:
   ```bash
   gh label list --repo <owner/repo> --json name
   ```
   If `"accepted"` appears in the list, run:
   ```bash
   gh issue edit <number> --repo <owner/repo> --add-label "accepted"
   ```
   If the label does not exist or the command fails, skip silently — labeling is advisory.

3. Post a comment on the GitHub issue:
   ```bash
   gh issue comment <number> --repo <owner/repo> --body "Tracked as tusk task #<task_id>. No timeline yet — will be addressed in a future session."
   ```
   If `gh` fails (e.g. insufficient permissions or locked issue), warn the user:
   > Could not post comment on issue #<N>. Please add it manually: "Tracked as tusk task #<task_id>. No timeline yet — will be addressed in a future session."

4. End with a decision summary:
   > **Deferred** — tusk task #<task_id> created. Issue #<N> commented (and labeled `accepted` if the label exists). No work started yet.

5. **Do NOT proceed to Step 7.** Stop after the comment.

## Step 6: Deduplicate and Insert

Check for semantic duplicates against the backlog from Step 3. If a likely duplicate exists, surface it:

> Possible duplicate: existing task #<id> — "<summary>". Proceed anyway?

If confirmed (or no duplicate found), insert with:

```bash
tusk task-insert "<summary>" "<description>" \
  --priority "<priority>" \
  --domain "<domain>" \
  --task-type "<task_type>" \
  --assignee "<assignee>" \
  --complexity "<complexity>" \
  --criteria "<criterion 1>" \
  --criteria "<criterion 2>" \
  --criteria "<criterion 3>"
```

Omit `--domain` and `--assignee` if NULL. Do not pass empty strings.

**Exit code 0** — success. Note the `task_id` from the JSON output.

**Exit code 1** — heuristic duplicate found. Report the matched task and stop:

> Skipped — duplicate of existing task #<id> (similarity <score>). Run `/tusk <id>` to work on it instead.

**Exit code 2** — error. Report and stop.

## Step 7: Begin Work (Steps 1–11 Only — implement-now path only)

**Skip this step entirely if the user chose defer.** Only proceed here when the user chose confirm (implement now).

Immediately invoke the `/tusk` workflow for the newly created task. Follow the "Begin Work on a Task" instructions from the tusk skill:

```
Read file: <base_directory>/../tusk/SKILL.md
```

Then execute those instructions starting at **"Begin Work on a Task (with task ID argument)"** using the `task_id` from Step 6. Do not wait for additional user confirmation — proceed directly into the development workflow.

**IMPORTANT: Execute /tusk steps 1–11 only. Do NOT execute step 12 (merge/retro).** Stop after step 11 (`/review-commits` or the lint step) — this skill owns merge, issue close, and retro as steps 8–10 below.

Hold onto the `session_id` returned by `tusk task-start` in step 1 of the /tusk workflow — it is required in step 8 below.

## Steps 8–10: Finalize (Run as an Unbroken Sequence — No User Confirmation Between Steps)

### Step 8: Merge

```bash
tusk merge <task_id> --session <session_id>
```

After the merge completes, capture the commit SHA for Step 9:

```bash
git log --oneline -1   # extract the short commit SHA from the first token
```

If the project uses PR-based merges, note the PR URL from the merge output or `gh pr list --state merged --limit 1`.

### Step 9: Close the GitHub Issue

```bash
gh issue close <number> --repo <owner/repo> --comment "Resolved in <commit_sha> — <pr_url_or_branch>. Tracked as tusk task #<task_id>."
```

Use the `commit_sha` from Step 8. If a PR URL is available, include it; otherwise use the branch name.

If the `gh` command fails, inspect the error output:
- If the output contains the phrase `already in a 'closed'` (e.g. `already in a 'closed' state`), post the resolution note as a standalone comment:
  ```bash
  gh issue comment <number> --repo <owner/repo> --body "Resolved in <commit_sha> — <pr_url_or_branch>. Tracked as tusk task #<task_id>."
  ```
  - If the comment succeeds, continue to Step 10 normally.
  - If the comment also fails (e.g. issue is locked), remind the user to add the note manually:
    > Issue #<N> is already closed and locked. Please add the resolution note manually at: https://github.com/<owner/repo>/issues/<N>
- Otherwise (e.g. insufficient permissions), report the error and remind the user to close the issue manually:
  > Could not close issue #<N> automatically. Please close it at: https://github.com/<owner/repo>/issues/<N>

### Step 10: Retro

Invoke `/retro` immediately — do not ask "shall I run retro?". Read and follow:

```
Read file: <base_directory>/../retro/SKILL.md
```
